Patrick: Can we use vite 6 for rendering the ReactJS (JSX) files? Im using vite 6 as my dev environment. Its also compatible with Node.JS 18 and only needs a bundle.js to effectively render in all EJS files

}

JSX updates {

aboutus.jsx: needs change in content
achievements.jsx: needs revision on the useEffect() fetch -> axios data, handleUnlock must set setUnlocked to update useState achievement tabs
dashboard.jsx: still needs revisions after the removal of the vocabulary test tab
maintest.jsx: in function 'active' set return setItemAnswered to 'isCompleted'
root.jsx: Note: root.jsx is still on the development phase to determine how it will respond to EJS rendering

}

CSS updates {
